                    Yeah... To say I'm not that good at introductions would be an understatement.
                    Nevertheless, again—welcome! This is my little chiseled corner of the web
                    that I use to showcase all my work and accomplishments in the life I've experienced up until now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, you'll find various showcases of works I've created—whether they be centred in the realm of writing or coding—which I've found
                    decent enough to be put on a grander display than the confines of a repo or a Google doc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But that's it for the baseline prelude into this portfolio of mine, so without further ado,
                    <b>this</b> is what I have to offer to you, visitor or potential future employer.

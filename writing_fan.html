                    Welcome! Take a seat right over there, have some cocoa, and watch as you gaze in amazement at my meagre fanfiction collection!
                    I can already understand that some of you find this really weird, and I can also agree with that. It's not like you see someone writing
                    for such stuff every day, but I can guarantee if you just give me and the rest of the people like me a chance, that we won't disappoint.
                </p>

                    For now, I've written almost entirely for the <b>Gravity Falls</b> fandom, but I also have an interest in other fandoms for shows, movies, and games I adore—
                     including but not limted to: <b>Avatar: The Last Airbender</b>, <b>BoJack Horseman</b>, and many other smaller ones you can find in my profile description.

                                The Gravity Falls water tower is a centerpiece of the sleepy Oregon town and offers one heck of a stunning view to those brave enough to climb on top. 
                                But when a certain girl and her conniving great-uncle go to test the limits of their resolve, what happens when the tables turn on them and the saviour becomes the one in need of saving? 
                                Set during/after "Fight Fighters".

                                Dipper Pines was never one to stand up for himself, especially when it came to bullies. 
                                But if there's one factor which could influence that, it's having his sister mixed up in his escapades. 
                                And that's when a seemingly normal day became something much more serious for the teen...

                                All it took for Stanley Pines, Man of Mystery, to question his stance toward children was one stormy night and a new face to meet. 
                                Toiling after the kid is a constant battle between a secretive past, a muddy present, and a frighteningly grim future. 
                                Yet out of that turmoil arises a question: what new will come of one more piece's entry into the endless puzzle that is Gravity Falls?

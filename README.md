# Portfolio Website for GLozanov
Portfolio website for programming and writing. Uses a Gulp setup, SCSS, and HTML. [Hosted on GitHub pages](https://katapultman.github.io/WEB-Project-2020). I decided to create this site to showcase my hobbies and the skills I've garnered throughout lifeâ€”whether they take form in projects or other work.

                    ...are pretty original, I'd say! 
                    Anyway, this is the page where I showcase all my supposedly original creations which I've 100% birthed only in my mind alone!
                    Do keep in mind that below is a display of all my writing prompt stories, which I refer to as duly original (in spite of what others might believe).
                    Take that as you will. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, yours truly, being the Reddit lurker they are, has taken all these prompts from the <b>r/WritingPrompts</b> subreddit and expanded them into their own stories.
                    I hope you enjoy them and they prove a good read!

                        A billionaire's child is kidnapped and a ransom is demanded for their return. 
                        The billionaire refuses and doesn't even bother to call the police, 
                        leaving the kidnapper so disgusted that they decide to raise the child themselves.

                        Your long-time friend suddenly asks you whether he is dreaming. 
                        Jokingly, you told him to try waking up. He vanishes before your eyes.

                        While driving, you hit and kill a boy. 
                        You feel terrible, and at the funeral you tell the family you wish you had died instead of him.
                        Three weeks later, a new surgery comes out that can bring someone back from the dead at the cost of another's life. 
                        You hear a knock at your door. 
                        It's the family.

                        You answer the door. 
                        It's a man you have never seen before. 
                        He hands you a duffel bag stuffed with hundred dollar bills.
                         "This is your cut, (name). Good work."

                        A girl who lost her childhood best friend due to an accident ten years ago still sends letters to his old address, 
                            even if she knows that no one lives there anymore. 
                        One day, someone sends a reply to her.

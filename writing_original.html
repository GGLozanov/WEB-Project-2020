                ...And always can't somehow ignore! 
                Yeah... To say I'm not that good at introductions would be an understatement.
                Nevertheless, again—welcome! This is my little chiseled corner of the web
                that I use to showcase all my work and accomplishments in the life I've experienced up until now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, you'll find various showcases of works I've created—whether they be centred in the realm of writing or coding—which I've found
                decent enough to be put on a grander display than the confines of a repo or a Google doc.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that's it for the baseline prelude into this portfolio of mine, so without further ado,
                <b>this</b> is what I have to offer to you, visitor or potential future employer.

                        A billionaire's child is kidnapped and a ransom is demanded for their return. 
                        The billionaire refuses and doesn't even bother to call the police, 
                        leaving the kidnapper so disgusted that they decide to raise the child themselves.

                        Your long-time friend suddenly asks you whether he is dreaming. 
                        Jokingly, you told him to try waking up. He vanishes before your eyes.

                        While driving, you hit and kill a boy. 
                        You feel terrible, and at the funeral you tell the family you wish you had died instead of him.
                        Three weeks later, a new surgery comes out that can bring someone back from the dead at the cost of another's life. 
                        You hear a knock at your door. 
                        It's the family.

                        You answer the door. 
                        It's a man you have never seen before. 
                        He hands you a duffel bag stuffed with hundred dollar bills.
                         "This is your cut, (name). Good work."

                        A girl who lost her childhood best friend due to an accident ten years ago still sends letters to his old address, 
                            even if she knows that no one lives there anymore. 
                        One day, someone sends a reply to her.
